# HeliAttack
 Heli Game using existing helciopter framework assets.
 
 Player flies about blowing stuff up.  Enemy forces will be AI controlled and grouped, moving about the level taking ground.  Player/Helicopter is more of a support role, carrying and moving troops to support positions under attack.
 
 Player has an AI allied force too.
